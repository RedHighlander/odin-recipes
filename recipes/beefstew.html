        <h2>Based on a traditional English beef and ale stew, this simplified, easy beef stew recipe features tender beef and vegetables in a thick, rich, and hearty gravy.</h2>
        <p>This recipe was inspired by a meal I had in a London pub a few years back. It was mid-February then too, and I couldn't seem to warm up. In classic pub food form, a hearty bowl of stew eaten at a heavy wooden table with a fire crackling on the hearth behind me was the best remedy.</p>
        <p>This beef and ale stew is the easy version of that classic pub recipe. But I share a couple tricks to save time without sacrificing flavor. This recipe whips up in just an hour from start to finish, which means it's doable even on a weeknight.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 Tbsp vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 lb. beef stew meat (cut into 1/4 in. cubes)</li>
            <li>1 large onion (diced)</li>
            <li>4 large cloves garlic (crushed)</li>
            <li>2 tsp minced fresh rosemary</li>
            <li>2 tsp medium carrots (peeled and diced)</li>
            <li>1 cup ale</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp tomato paste</li>
            <li>2 tsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 tsp Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>1 tsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
            <li>1 bay leaf</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp cornstarch (dissolved in 1/4 cup cold water to form a slurry)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oil in a 5-quart pot over medium heat.</li>
            <li>To the pot, add the beef stew meat in a single layer. Let it sear on both sides, about 3 minutes total (don't stir it until it starts to caramelize on the first side; this takes about 90 seconds). Stir in the onion and cook 2 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook 30 seconds, stirring constantly.</li>
            <li>Add the rosemary, thyme, carrot, ale, tomato paste, Worcestershire sauce, Dijon mustard, soy sauce, salt, black pepper, and bay leaf. Give it a good stir.</li>
            <li>Bring up to a boil, and then cover the pot. Turn the heat down slightly so it's at a gentle boil, and cook until the meat is tender and the liquid is evaporated, about 30 minutes, stirring frequently.</li>
            <li>Stir in the cornstarch slurry and cook until thickened, about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Serve.</li>
        </ol>
